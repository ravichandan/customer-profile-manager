## Customer Profile Manager


### Assumptions
* The system can be interacted only through web and mobile channels, not through any third party applications.
* Auth server is in place for Authentication and authorization.
* A node webserver to enable server-side rendering for webapp.

### Project Architecture 
![Project Architecture](ProjectArchitecture.png)

* User uses mobile or web UI to interact with the system to deal with customer data. 
Users can send three types of requests, `'Create Customer'` request, `'Delete Customer'` or a `'Update Customer'` request with customer details. 
* The data that is sent through these channels is received by backend NodeJs server. 
* This server sends the request to 'API Gateway' which verifies the access token with the 'Auth Server'.
    - If the token is invalid, 401 response is sent back to ask the user for authentication. 
    - If the token is valid, depending on the type of request, the corresponding service will be called.
    - The complete security mechanism is explained in the Security section below.  
* Customer Profile system has mainly 3 services for different request types, this is to enable horizontal scalability and high throughput.
    - There can other utility services (example: `Validation service` or `Notification Service`)    
* Once a service receives a request it verifies the access token received in header with Auth Server.
    - If the request is valid, it sends the data to CRM system by calling its APIs. The response from CRM is sent back to client.
    - If the request is invalid, 401 response is sent back so that the upstreams can request for authentication. 


### API Contract
API Contract is done in swagger. Find the file with name `'Api Contract Swagger.yaml'` in the project root folder. 


### Security
The below flow diagram explains the Authentication and Authorization mechanisms in detail.

### Project Code
This project shows the middleware mechanism of Customer CRUD services and their interaction with API Gateway and Auth Server.
* `Create Service` to create customer by taking all the details in json.
* `Read Service` to find a customer by id.
* `Update Service` to update an existing customer by taking all the details in json.  
* `Delete Service` to delete a customer by id. 

`Authorization` header is to be sent for all the requests to the API Gateway and it authorizes the token with Auth server and forwards the request only if its valid. JUnit test cases were included to cover all the scenarios of the business logic flow. 

#### How to run:

- **Run the test cases to see the functionality.** Feel free to edit or add more.

- You can also run the Spring boot app by running `CustomerProfilerApplication` class by placing the correct domain, port and path values in application.properties.
